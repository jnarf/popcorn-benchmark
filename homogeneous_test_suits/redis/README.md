This README is just a fast *quick start* document.

1)Compilation
    Just run make -j 'nproc' . We have everything in place to compile and get the binaries. 
2)Testing 
    Copy the binaries to both x86 and ARM machines. Rename the  natives binaries to common name in both machines.
    Now you can test the functioning.
