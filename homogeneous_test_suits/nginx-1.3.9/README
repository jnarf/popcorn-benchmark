NGINX 1.3.9 testsuite for Popcorn homogeneous benchmark testing

This benchmark suite has been tested with two x86 VMs.

Setting up x86 VMs

	Download VM Image from "https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7RfKPGm2YZsaURxTVh5ZTMyTk0"
************************************
	Command for Downloading large files from Gdrive --> 
	"wget --load-cookies /tmp/cookies.txt "https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&confirm=$(wget --quiet --save-cookies /tmp/cookies.txt --keep-session-cookies --no-check-certificate 'https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=FILEID' -O- | sed -rn 's/.*confirm=([0-9A-Za-z_]+).*/\1\n/p')&id=FILEID" -O FILENAME && rm -rf /tmp/cookies.txt "
*************************************
	
	Change the FILEID with ID. Example for above image :" 0B7RfKPGm2YZsaURxTVh5ZTMyTk0" part from the above link.
	Change the FILENAME as x86.img."This takes time to download."

	Make a copy of the image with another name as x86_2.img.
Now the Home folder should look like this. 		
	

Setup the messaging layer in the VMs. (Core of Popcorn) :

	Wiki Link --> https://github.com/ssrg-vt/popcorn-kernel/wiki/VM-Setup#setup-the-popcorn-messaging-layer
		For homogeneous copy the x86 verison of msg_layer.ko to both VMs.

Building the nginx benchmark suite:

	1)Execute the "configure" script present in the root folder of benchmark suite.
	2) make -j8

copy the "nginx" executable to the VMs. 

Running the benchmark suite.

	1) Run the nginx from home folder of Node 0 VM of the popcorn layer.

Migration points placed

	205 --> migrate(1,NULL,NULL);  //Migrate to Node 1 from Node 0
	278 --> migrate(0,NULL,NULL);  //Migrate to Node 0 from Node 1

	//You can play around placing migration points at any part of the code. 	//The order of migration is to be kept in mind while placeing the points.
