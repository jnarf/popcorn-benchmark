1) Compilation
    To build the heterogeneous nginx project , just "./myconfig.sh" on root folder will suffice.
    The binaries are generated in obj folder.

2) Testing Copy the binaries to both x86 and ARM machines. Rename the natives binaries to common name in both machines. Now you can test the functioning.
